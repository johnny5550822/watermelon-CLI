2014 inventathon---Application of eulerian video magnification in vessel block detection for patients with Critical Limb Ischemia
==============

Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) disease have blockage in major arteries in one leg or both legs, leading to insufficient blood supply to leg muscle, and toes. CLI usually coexisit with other diseases, such as diabetes, etc, it is hard for patients to discover it at the disease's early stage. Current pre-screening process is performbed by doctors in clinics, which is by a blood pressure test called Ankle-Brachial Index(ABI) Test. However, the test is not fully reliable, and it has to be performed in clinics. 

We attempt to apply Eulerian Video Magnification to detect "invisible" blood flow (~pulse change) on a patient's diseased leg. Our experiment includes healthy leg and a "diseased" leg (mimic the disease by applying pressure on the leg). We clearly show that we can utlize Eulerian Video Magnification to detect the blood flow's difference between legs.

This github repository contains: Eulerian packages, "maindemo.m", and "playmoviestogether.m". The data folder contains the eulerian video magnification processed videos.
